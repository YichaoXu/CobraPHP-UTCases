# PHP Testability Patterns

Each pattern is defined as a folder named with pattern ID and pattern name. If the pattern is characterized by more than 1 instance, subfolders are present for each of them. In the main folder is present a markdown file explaining the pattern and resuming its characteristics (feature vs internal API, negative test case, measurements results, discovery rule), .php implementation files, and a .bash file for the opcode analyzed for the creation of the discovery rule.

84 Patterns have been identified, with a total of 122 patterns instances.

- 39 for Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- 7 for Negative Test Cases
- 16 Security Related
- 26 referred to Internal API

Concerning the Static-Dynamic features, we have:

- 70 Static
- 6 Dynamic D1
- 28 Dynamic D2
- 4 Dynamic D3
- 14 Dynamic D4

[Testability_Patterns.pdf](https://github.com/GiuliCler/testability_tarpits/blob/main/PHP/Testability_Patterns/Testability_Patterns.pdf) sums up all the patterns created.
